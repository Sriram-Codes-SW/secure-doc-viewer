### Exercise 4.1 ★ Class or record?

A tile's row and column: a record, because it is plain data that never changes. An account whose password can change: a class, because it has changing state and hides its fields. A search result: a record, because it is a fixed bundle of values.

### Exercise 4.2 ★ Write a record

```java
public class TileRefDemo {
    record TileRef(int row, int col) { }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new TileRef(2, 1));
    }
}
```

`toString` prints `TileRef[row=2, col=1]`.

### Exercise 4.3 ★★ Add an enum

One good answer: `enum TileStatus { QUEUED, READY, FAILED }`, then `TileStatus s = TileStatus.READY; if (s == TileStatus.READY) { ... }`. Enum values are compared with `==` because each value exists once.
