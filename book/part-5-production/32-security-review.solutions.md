# Solutions: Chapter 32

### Exercise 32.1 ★ Find the control

- PDF: `TileGenerationService` (deletes the source after ingest) and `TileController` (the only pixel endpoint).
- Tile: `SignedUrlService` (HMAC and expiry) and `SessionKeys` (session binding).
- Document: the `document/` package (`DocumentService` checks owner, visibility, and shares).
- Account: `LoginThrottle` (counters) and `SecurityConfig` (registers `PasswordChangeRequiredFilter`).
- Session: `SecurityConfig` (CSRF repository, cookie settings, session management).
- Availability: `TileGenerationService` (limits, render pool, timeout) and `TileRateLimiter`.
- Audit trail: `TileController` (`PAGE_VIEW_AUDIT_INTERVAL`, 10 minutes) and the `audit/` package.

Run `git grep -n ClassName book-m5-platform` to confirm each path.

### Exercise 32.2 ★★ Predict the denial

With `denyAll()` first, every request matches it before any other rule, so every request is refused, including `POST /api/auth/login` and `GET /actuator/health`. The health check failing is the surprise: the compose health check for the app container would report it unhealthy, so `web` (which depends on a healthy `app`) would not start. Most security integration tests fail, because they expect sign-in to work.

### Exercise 32.3 ★★ Threat-model a new feature

A model answer. Asset: the audit history (who viewed what, and when). Actors: administrators (allowed), other roles (not), an attacker with a stolen reader session. Entry points: the export endpoint and its query parameters. Controls: restrict the endpoint to `ADMIN` in `SecurityConfig` (as `/api/admin/**` already is); neutralize spreadsheet formulas in exported cells (the existing CSV export does this); cap the number of rows or the date range per export so one request cannot exhaust memory. Any two of these earn full credit.

### Exercise 32.4 ★★★ Attack the lockout

The first design counted failures per account across all addresses. Anyone could fail 20 times against a victim's username and lock the real owner out (a denial of service against the victim).

The recognised-device design applies that account-wide counter only to attempts from unrecognised devices. The attacker's gain: while an account is under a distributed attack, its owner cannot sign in from a new device (new laptop, hotel network) until the window passes or an administrator unlocks it. An attacker who knows this can time an attack to coincide with a victim's travel.

A mitigation not in the app: a second proof for unrecognised devices, such as an emailed one-time code or MFA, so that a new device can prove itself without waiting for an administrator.
